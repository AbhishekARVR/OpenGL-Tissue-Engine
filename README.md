# OpenGL Tissue Engine

A real-time soft-body physics simulation engine built with OpenGL, designed to simulate deformable tissue-like materials with realistic mesh deformation and cloth-like behavior.

## Features

### Core Simulation
- **Soft-Body Physics**: Position based dynamics system for realistic tissue deformation
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated OpenGL rendering pipeline
- **Mesh Deformation**: Dynamic vertex manipulation with proper deformation on movement

### Technical Implementation
- **Separated Buffer Architecture**: Independent position and color buffers for efficient GPU operations
- **Custom Mesh Abstraction**: Modular mesh creation and management system

### Graphics Pipeline
- Modern OpenGL rendering
- Vertex and fragment shader support
- Efficient buffer management (VBO/VAO)
- Real-time mesh updates

## Dependencies
- **GLFW**: Window creation and input handling
- **GLAD**: OpenGL extension loading
- **GLM**: Mathematics library for graphics
